<b>Broken stuff</b>
<ol>
<li>My Javascript handling doesn't work for titles with weird characters like colons (:) or other stuff like that.</li>
<li>Everything is still in JSON. Better to reconvert to normal site pages then rereconvert to JSON so we have functioning pages if JSON doesn't work on client-side</li>
</ol>
