# MovieApp
Everything about film.<br/>


<strong>Remember to update LOG file after working!</strong>

<b>TODO(Also check Projects section on Github)</b>
<ol>
<li><strike>Merge Log In and Movie Search Site and get rid of any uneccessary features.</strike></li>
<li>Discuss what main feature will be and implement.</li>
<li>PHPfy the rest of the site to hide API keys</li>
<li>Make an Accounts preferences functionality. Shit like take the name and change pass and stuff. Also We could echo the First name instead of the username once this functionality is added. So like "Hello Jon" instead of "Hello ichbinjon"</li>


</ol>

<b>Stuff to keep in mind when making changes</b>

1 Make sure there are no dead-links (i.e. changing file names/locations and switching .html to .php or vice versa)

2 Clean, modular code

<b>Broken stuff</b>
<ol>
<li>My Javascript handling doesn't work for titles with weird characters like colons (:) or other stuff like that.</li>
<li>Everything is still in JSON. Better to reconvert to normal site pages then rereconvert to JSON so we have functioning pages if JSON doesn't work on client-side</li>
</ol>
